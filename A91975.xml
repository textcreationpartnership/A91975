         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When I firſt met with and read over his Relation, I was reſolved wholly to ſlight it, as an impudent piece, which refuted it ſelf, and could not do the leaſt wrong, either to the Truth or Me, with any impartiall Reader, which might poſsibly come to have the reading of it: but when I conſidered that he had taken the boldneſs to preſent it to the Judges of Aſsiſes at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> (as a preparative to his ſuppoſed triall) and that multitudes of Copies were diſperſed in City and Country, which might ſtumble ſome unſtable ſouls, ignorant of the Truth, of <hi>Coppin,</hi> and what had paſſed betwixt me and him, I thought it my duty to draw up and publiſh this Narrative, which now at length preſents it ſelf to thy view.

            <p>IT is now ſome four or five years ſince one <hi>Joſeph Salmon</hi> came firſt into theſe parts; and after ſome flouriſhing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes made in <hi>Chatham, Stroud, Margrets,</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Pariſh-Churches, at length he ſet up a courſe of preaching every Sabbath day in the Cathedrall at <hi>Rocheſter;</hi> where his manner was to Allegorize the Scripture, and make a noſe of wax of it, forcing ſome Allegoricall ſenſe on the plaineſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall and Doctrinall paſſages of Old and New Teſtament: He decried all forms whatſoever, in Religion (not excepting the form of ſound words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.) he deſperatly undermined the whole myſtery of godlineſs, and ſowed the ſeeds of Ranting Familiſm; yet mannaged his devilliſh deſigns ſo ſlily and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, that it was not eaſie for an ordinary hearer to diſcover them, though to a judicious ear, they were diſcernable enough; his language was ſmooth and taking, eſpecially with carnall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, that delight more in Play-books, then in the Book of God.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168391:8"/>preach twice every Lords day, in the Cathedrall, where <hi>Salmon</hi> was wont to preach, before him; and being exactly of the ſame principles with his brother in evil, that preceded him, he began to play his game, and to expreſs himſelf for the ſubſtance, in his ſtrain, venting the ſame errours, but more openly, and with leſs Artifice of words, than the other had done; indeed <hi>Salmon</hi> told him at his going away (as I am informed by a Salmoniſt which heard it) that after he was gone, he would be ſo open, that he would be laid hold of, which accordingly by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is come to paſs. <hi>Coppins</hi> doctrines were ſo groſs from Sabbath to Sabbath, that they were in the mouthes of many that heard him: Whereupon (hearing what a Preacher was come amongſt us, and perceiving what a reſort of Auditors there was to him) one Sabbath day, about the later end of <hi>September,</hi> or beginning of <hi>October</hi> (as I remember) I went to hear him; his Text he then treated on, was <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. his whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a curſed gloſs that corrupted the Text, he had ſcarce one ſound paſſage from the beginning to the end of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he then affirmed, <hi>That Chriſt the Redeemer was a ſinner, in reſpect of his humane nature, that all mankinde was the body of Chriſt, redeemed and to be ſaved by him; That neither Job in that place, nor S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>did ſpeak of the reſurrection of the body,</hi> with many more peſtilent errours: I confeſs my ſpirit was much ſtirred at the hearing of him, and I took occaſion to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my deteſtation of his errours and blaſphemies to one that ſtood by me, reſolving in due time to witneſs againſt them, both publickly and privately, as I had occaſion: His Diſcourſe being ended, I immediatly went out, not thinking it fit at that time, in that Auditory, to object any thing againſt him; though in the cloſe of his Diſcourſe, <hi>he invited any man to do it, that was not ſatisfied in what he had delivered:</hi> but very ſhortly after, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Pariſh Church, I took occaſion to witneſs againſt what I had heard in the Cathedrall; warning the people to take heed of ſuch Doctrines, and the broachers of them; whereupon (as I was inform'd) <hi>Coppin</hi> renews his challenges every Sermon he preacht. <hi>That if any were offended with what then, or at any other time he had delivered, they ſhould object, and he would anſwer for himſelf; complaining of thoſe that would ſpeak and preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him behinde his back, but never object any thing to his face.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168391:8"/>Hereupon (that we might countermine this underminer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and vindicate the truth of Chriſt in that place where it had been ſo much contradicted, and blaſphemed) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> began the Lecture <hi>October</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and ſo we continued it from week to week; every Lecture we preacht more or leſs declaring our ſelves againſt ſome of <hi>Coppins</hi> errours; he likewiſe continued his Sabbath daies Diſcourſes, with a very great reſort of all ſorts to hear him; with open mouth he railed againſt the <hi>Prieſts that told people of their ſins, and would make them beleeve, that God was angry with any of them for their ſinnes; he continued his challenges of any that would, to object againſt his Doctrine;</hi> and <hi>November</hi> 4.

               <hi>of</hi> November) <hi>he would give his Auditory a Sermon, and be ready, after his Sermon, to anſwer whatſoever ſhould be objected againſt his Doctrine, either then, or formerly delivered;</hi> accordingly next day he preacht (or rather prated) according to his manner, and when he had done, he cal'd upon his opponents (if any were there) to ſpeak what they had to ſay againſt him; when yet he could not but know that my Brethren and I who had declared our abhorrency of his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and blaſphemies, were not then at leaſure for him, nor had he any reaſon to expect us. After when I heard of thoſe dog-tricks, Tueſday <hi>November</hi> the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (preaching M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peglars</hi> turn, who had been ſick, and was not yet recovered) after my Sermon on <hi>Jobs</hi> Creed, with the Preface to it, and the uſe his unkinde friends ſhould have made of it, <hi>Job</hi> 17.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. I took notice of <hi>Coppins</hi> challenges, and of his tricks to delude the people, giving the preſent Auditory to underſtand, that on the Tueſday following I would be ready in that place, to object againſt him, and in caſe he did not appear to anſwer for himſelf, or give a reaſonable account for his <hi>non</hi>-appearance, it ſhould be interpreted for a tergiverſation and confeſſion of the badneſs of his cauſe: To leave him without all excuſe, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to intimate thus much in a few lines to him under my hand,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168391:9"/>accordingly that afternoon I drew up a few lines to him, which were left at his lodging by a ſure hand, but he was gone to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and came not home till Saturday night; next day being the Lords day, I received three or four lines from him, wherein <hi>he ſignified his receipt of mine, at his coming home; and (withall) that ſince he was not at home to meet me on Thurſday, he would next morning</hi> (<hi>which was Moonday the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>of</hi> December) <hi>not fail to meet me at nine of the clock in the place appointed; proclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Auditors that day, his undertaking for the next day, that he might have as conſiderable a party of his own proſelytes at the meeting, as was poſſible:</hi> The next morning by nine of the clock was a great concourſe of people in the Cathedrall, and <hi>Coppin</hi> (before either the Maior or Capt. <hi>Smith</hi> were come) poſſeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Pulpit, where <hi>(ad populum faciendum)</hi> he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to make a prayer introductory to what was to follow, as if he had been a very conſciencious devout man in prayer, when God knows, and thoſe that know him, know him to be a man that takes himſelf to be ſuch a high Attainer as hath gotten above prayer, which he looks upon as a needleſs and low form, to the uſe whereof he doth rather condeſcend for the infirmity of others, then conform out of any neceſſity of his own: His prayer being ended, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Maior, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Smith,</hi> with a very great aſſembly, being preſent, after a ſhort prayer that God would appear for the vindication of his truth, and detection of errours, I propounded this Propoſition to <hi>Coppin: He that perſwades the people to beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt was a ſinner, and that the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt was polluted with ſin, he is a perverter of Scripture, a blaſphemer of Jeſus Chriſt, and a venter of damnable hereſie:</hi> Having laid down this Propoſition, before I proceeded to the Aſſumption, I thought fit to require his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Propoſition, which he needed not have ſtuck at, had his judgement been ſound, but being conſcious how heavy it would fall upon him, if granted, yet not daring to deny it, he ſpent many words to no purpoſe, neither granting nor denying it, till at length being weary of preſſing him to give his anſwer in that particular: when the Aſſumption was on my tongues end, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that in ſtead of granting or denying my Propoſition, he gave me a clear and full proof of my Aſſumption, before I could bring it forth, declaring it to be his judgement, that Jeſus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168391:9"/>Chriſt in his humane nature was a ſinner, and that the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt was polluted with ſin: Whereupon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and admiring the good hand of Gods providence) I added my Aſſumption to the former Propoſition; <hi>That</hi> Rich. Coppin <hi>was a perſwader of the people to beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt was a ſinner and that his humane nature was polluted with ſin,</hi> and ſo inferr'd the Concluſion, <hi>That he was a perverter of Scripture, a blaſphemer of Jeſus Chriſt, and a venter of damnable hereſie,</hi> but then being pincht with the Syllogiſm, <hi>he denied what he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the hearing of ſo many witneſſes,</hi> which not only M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Head</hi> did witneſs to his face, but many more were ready to witneſs, and are ready to teſtifie upon Oath, if called to it; yet in effect, he did afterwards avouch the ſame blaſphemy, though in other terms, and more covertly. Being charged with the Doctrine of univerſall ſalvation, he at large avouched it, adding, <hi>that all the good works that men did, ſhould do them no good, and all the evil works which men did ſhould do them no hurt.</hi> Being charged with blaſphemy for aſſerting, <hi>That Chriſt was a curſed Goat, for the Geats at the left hand,</hi> he made a long diſcourſe to juſtifie that aſſertion by Scripture, wherein how miſerably he did abuſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is to be ſeen in part, by what himſelf hath printed: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other errours at this meeting he openly aſſerted, which were ſo groſs, that I am very confident, all that feared God and heard them, could not but have their ſpirits mov'd with juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt them, and the broacher of them. I ſhall not now trouble the world by giving any further account of what further paſs't between <hi>Coppin</hi> and my ſelf at this meeting, only thus much I muſt needs ſay, and 'tis well known to many I ſpeak but the truth in it, <hi>Coppins</hi> printed relation repreſents neither the title, nor (for the moſt part) the truth of what I ſpake; there is no man of any judgement that knows me, and reads his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, but will conceive ſo, by what he hath printed; for his own ſpeeches he miſ-reports them to, leaving out and putting in what he pleaſeth, he uſes thoſe terms of Art, and diſtinctions in print, which neither I nor any man elſe that heard him, heard from his mouth at that time, nor did he ſeem to have any knowledge of them, what tale ſoever he now tels for himſelf, which yet is bad enough. In the concluſion of that meeting it was ſome content to my ſpirit, that God had made me inſtrumentail to unkennell
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168391:10"/>ſuch a Fox, and make him ſo to ſtink, that all the ſheep of Chriſt which heard him, or heard of him, would thenceforth take heed how they came near him, or had to do with him; one thing by the way I may not omit to mention, When I had ended this daies conteſt with <hi>Coppin,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gammon</hi> came to me, and thank't me, telling me I never did better ſervice for Chriſt in all my life, to which I anſwered, I ſhould have a time for him to, and ſo left him. The next day being Tueſday, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> having preacht his Lecture, propounded two Queries, which he was reſolved to maintain againſt <hi>Coppin</hi> the Thurſday ſeven night after; and that <hi>Coppin</hi> might have notice of them, they were fixed upon the Church-door, but before Thurſday came about (by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168391:10"/>for the preſent I did not think worth the while to reſell, nor had I time or opportunity to do it, he was ſo voluminous, and took up ſo much time in his ramblings, multiplying quotations of wreſted Scriptures ſo thick, as if the devil himſelf had prompted him, which I am perſwaded he did. Well then I was now reſolved by the grace of God, and in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, to eſtabliſh on a Scripture-foundation ſome of thoſe precious truths which <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> (by perverting Scripture) had indeavoured to undermine; to this end, deſiring in the firſt place to aſcribe righteouſneſs to my glorious Maker and gratious Redeemer, I produced ſeverall Scriptures to demonſtrate that the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt was never polluted with the leaſt ſpot of ſin original or actual, but was from the firſt conception perfectly holy, otherwiſe it had been impoſſible it could have been aſſumed to Hypoſtaticall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the holy Sonne of God; and this holineſs of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature I derived not ſimply from the Virginity of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but from his Conception by the holy Ghoſt of a Virgin-Mother, the holy Ghoſt perfectly ſanctifying that part of her ſeed, of which the humane nature of Chriſt was formed, from the very firſt moment of its conception, wherein it was alſo aſſumed into perſonall union with the holy Son of God, the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the bleſſed Trinity; who ever ſince hath been, and for ever ſhall be God and man in one Perſon; for this I alleadg'd and improv'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. &amp; 7.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. ſhewing the horrible and damnable blaſphemy or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſſertion, pulling the Crown from the Head o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168391:11"/>which Jeſus Chriſt did take upon him, was ſinfull and polluted with ſin; and thinking to enſnare me, demanded of me who that High-prieſt was, mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. to which I anſwered, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſucceſſors, which in ſome things only were types of Chriſt: but then another (whoſe voice only I heard, but knew not who it was) very <hi>unwiſely</hi> (at beſt) made anſwer, that it was meant of Chriſt out of doubt; which anſwer I was ſo farre from approving of, (having declared my ſelf to the contrary before) that I openly profeſt it was the anſwer of ſome Prevaricator, that was reſolved to gratifie <hi>Coppin</hi> in betraying the truth; yet <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> having gotten this anſwer from another mouth, did own it as the truth, and did over and over aſſert (as his judgement) from that Scripture, that Jeſus Chriſt did not only offer for the ſins of the people, but for his own ſins; however he is pleaſed to mend the matter in the relation made by his lying Pamphlet; nor did God ſuffer the devil to remember him of that other Scripture which he hath foiled into the margent of his printed relation, and would no doubt have made uſe of it at that time, had it come to his minde, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. which at firſt view to a ſuperficiall reader, might ſeem to make much more for his wicked purpoſe; though it be clear, what Chriſt is ſaid to do once, is not <hi>to offer firſt for his own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people;</hi> which were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the former verſe, (where Chriſt is repreſented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſin at all of his own) and to it ſelf, for to offer firſt for his own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people, were to offer twice at leaſt, and not once only; but the meaning is plain, that in ſtead of many ſacrifices which the typicall High-prieſts (being ſinners themſelves) offered daily, firſt for their own ſins, and then for the peoples, Jeſus Chriſt the great High-prieſt (being holy, and having no ſin of his own to offer for) did only once for all offer himſelf up in his humane nature, a ſpotleſs ſacrifice for the ſins of his people: Well, having in ſome meaſure, through Gods mercy, aſſerted from Scripture and vindicated the ſpotleſs purity and holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt (which <hi>Coppin</hi> blaſphemouſly denied, adding a further blaſphemy, that Chriſt offered for his own ſins, as well as for the ſins of the people,) I proceeded (from <hi>Job</hi> 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the example of Chriſt, and other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to vindicate the reſurrection of the body; alleadging this (which <hi>Coppin</hi> would not take notice of) that the bodies of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168391:11"/>beleevers were the members of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. and therefore ſhould be raiſed to glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. but <hi>Coppin</hi> ſtill harped on a ſpiritual reſurrection, thereby ſeeking to elude all that could be ſaid for a reſurrection of the body; whereupon I deſired it might be conſidered, whether he did not revive the Hereſie of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus,</hi> and whether that Scripture might not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. Upon this <hi>Coppin</hi> having put me to give an account what I did conceive of Jeſus Chriſt, which I readily did, in ſeveral particulars, Of his Natures, Perſon, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Eſtates, of Humiliation to the Croſs, and Exaltation to the Throne, on which he ſhall judge the world: Then of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he took upon him to give ſome account of his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning Chriſt, whom he aſſerted to be <hi>all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity, affirming the three Perſons to be but three mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations or appearances of that one God which is Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> when afterwards I alledg'd what Chriſt ſpeaks concerning the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt (amongſt other Arguments) againſt his Hell-hatcht Doctrine of Univerſall Salvation, he aſſerted ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinions concerning that ſin, that (for my part) I ſhall not blot paper with them, his printed Pamphlet ſpeaks ſo much, that every ſober conſciencious perſon may eaſily perceive how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably he doth pervert the meaning of our Saviours words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that unpardonable ſin, whereof I am afraid he is but too deeply guilty, he doth ſo deſperatly contradict and blaſpheme the cleareſt truths of the bleſſed Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, whereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo converſant in Scripture as he hath been) his conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be convicted; he now ſhewed himſelf tooth and nail for his darling hereſie of Univerſall Salvation; diſclaiming any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgement but what doth paſs upon men in this life, aſſerting no eternall deſtruction of any mans perſon whatſoever to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, with ſeverall other things of the like nature, wherein I was content at laſt to give him rope enough, and let him run himſelf out of breath (if it had been poſſible) that ſo all preſent that feared God, might be convinc't from his own mouth, of his deſperate and devilliſh doctrines vented by him; but at length perceiving the patience of the Auditory quite tired, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied my ſelf to hear the Word of God ſo wretchedly and wickedly abuſed: In fine I reſolved never more to have do with him, unleſs I ſhould be called to it by ſuch as had authority, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168391:12"/>required to vindicate the truth againſt him; ſuppoſing ſuch a full diſcovery of him to be now made, that there needed no more to be done to that purpoſe: I then only urg'd two Arguments againſt him as the reſult of what had dropt from his own mouth; the firſt was this: <hi>He that is a falſe Prophet, and propheſies lies in the Name of the Lord, he is an enemy to the State; But</hi> Rich. Coppin <hi>is a falſe Prophet, and propheſies lies in the Name of the Lord;</hi> Ergo, Rich. Coppin <hi>is an enemy to the State.</hi> The ſecond was this, or to this purpoſe, <hi>He that cauſeth diviſions contrary to the received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Scripture, ſerving not the Lord Jeſus, but his own belly, by good words and fair ſpeeches, beguiling the hearts of the ſimple, ought to be avoided by conſciencious Chriſtians, as they would avoid Rocks and Quicksands,</hi> Rom. 16.17, 18. <hi>But</hi> Rich Coppin <hi>is ſuch a one: Ergo.</hi> Then what followed after this, I need not mention, nor will I trouble my ſelf with <hi>Coppins</hi> relation: after I had made a ſhort addreſs to God in prayer, the Congregation diſmiſſed, and ſo I departed. The Thurſday after, <hi>December</hi> 13. appointed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> to ſtate and maintain his Queries againſt <hi>Coppin,</hi> there was again a great reſort of people in the foreſaid place, and <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> (as before) plac't himſelf in the Pulpit, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> took the oppoſite Pew, where after his prayer, waving his firſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſufficiently cleared and vindicated before, he inſiſted only on his ſecond; and having premiſed a few words only by way of ſuppoſition, he laid down his Argument, the ſcope whereof was to prove <hi>Coppin</hi> guilty of higheſt blaſphemy, for affirming Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be evil ſpirits, in affirming, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever told people of their ſins, and of damnation for their ſins, were evil ſpirits:</hi> This he could and would have proved againſt <hi>Coppin,</hi> but the truth is, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> ſoon perceiving that <hi>Coppin</hi> would not be held cloſe to any thing in way of Syllogiſticall Diſpute, but diverted to Queries, and took occaſion to leave the main Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie which ſhould have been proſecuted, withall finding himſelf extreamly diſadvantaged, by the thickneſs of his hearing, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his voice, with other diſtempers, which at preſent oppreſſed him, he ſoon gave <hi>Coppin</hi> off, thinking it but loſt labour to have further to do with him: now truly for my part, it was once in my thoughts not to have been preſent at this daies meeting, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> had done him too much honour in vouchſafing to encounter him afreſh, after ſuch a diſcovery as himſelf had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168391:12"/>made of his own ſhamefull nakedneſs; yet upon ſecond thoughts, I could not but conceiv that God in his wiſe providence had offered me one opportunity more, wherein I might give in my teſtimony more clearly and fully againſt this wretched blaſphemer of Jeſus Chriſt, and then I reſolved not to neglect the opportunity, accordingly I came to the meeting, and joyning my ſelf with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sandbrooke</hi> in the ſame Pew, when he had ended, I ſtood up, and addreſſing my ſelf, not to <hi>Coppin,</hi> but to the Magiſtrates of the City, Officers of the Army, and the reſt of the auditory, I gave them to underſtand, that I came not there to ſuccenturate my Learned Brother, who was abundantly able to make good what he had undertaken againſt <hi>Coppin;</hi> but my deſign was to take this opportunity of ſpeaking a few words for the benefit of the people then aſſembled, I told them I had ſeen ſo much of <hi>Coppin,</hi> that unleſs I were call'd to it by ſuch as had authority, I was conſtant to my reſolution of medling no more with him; yet on all occaſions I ſhould be ready to witneſs againſt his Hereſies and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies: and whereas he had at the former meeting, <hi>December</hi> 11. maintained, <hi>That the Doctrine of the love of God in the ſalvation of all men whatſoever, was the moſt effectuall Doctrine to reſtrain from ſin, and promote ſanctification;</hi> I gave them to underſtand that indeed the true Doctrine of Gods ſpeciall love to his people, it was a moſt effectuall means to promote ſanctification in the children of God, that have a child-like gracious diſpoſition in them; but the falſe doctrine of Gods generall love unto all whatſoever, is ſo far from being a means of ſanctification to any, that it opens a gap for all ungodlineſs, ſtrengthening the hearts and hands of all ungodly and wicked men, that no man ſhould return from his wickedneſs; with much more to the ſame purpoſe: and becauſe the Doctrine of Univerſal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as 'tis held forth by our Anabaptiſts (who thence inferre Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Salvation of all from Original ſin) is a dangerous doctrine, near of kin to <hi>Coppins</hi> doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, I therefore hinted ſome things againſt that doctrine; affirming, that the Elect of God are not actually ſaved from Original ſin, before they are effectually called, but are dead in it, and therefore thoſe that are never effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, are never ſaved from it, but whoſoever are damned for actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, are alſo damned for Originall ſin; yea I made no queſtion but many Infant-children, never guilty of any actuall ſin, might be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hell for that Originall ſin wherein they were conceived and born: And whereas <hi>Coppin</hi> had ſuggeſted, againſt me, I was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168391:13"/>to the State, upon the account of my oppoſing him in his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Blaſphemies, I minded the Auditory how that there were ſome intruſted in the preſent Government, who would count it a diſhonour to be repreſented as countenancers of ſuch a Blaſphemer, and diſcouragers of his conſciencious oppoſers; hereupon I crav'd leave to reade a Liſt of ſome of his errours, which he had at the two former meetings vented; and ſo I read this following Liſt:

                  <item>4. <hi>That a man can have no aſſurance of his own ſalvation, unleſs he beleeve this doctrine; for if there be but one in the world to be damned, he might ſuſpect himſelf to be that man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>That all the good works that men do, can do them no good.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>That the Scripture ſpeaks only of a ſpirituall reſurrection, and there ſhall be no reſurrection of the bodies of men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is all the three Perſons in the Trinity, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and holy Ghoſt, and that all the three Perſons, are but ſo many manifeſtations of God.</hi>

                  <item>10. <hi>That hell is within men before they beleeve, and that there is no ſuch hell as is commonly beleeved, to be a place of torment to any after this life.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>11. <hi>That the doctrine which affirms no redemption out of hell is falſe, That there is redemption out of hell.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe devilliſh doctrines (which yet were not one half of what he had vented) being read in his hearing, he did not, could not deny one of them, but ſpent many words to juſtifie the third, and the laſt of them, adding ſeverall more at this time, this among the reſt, <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf was that one Leper of ten, who being made whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to give God thanks;</hi> quoting many Scriptures, but allegorizing and wreſting all againſt the truth; inſomuch that I could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168391:13"/>my judgement, that if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> were preſent, he would beſpeak him, as once he did <hi>Elymas,</hi> Act. 13.10, 11. and that with like ſucceſs, cauſing him to grope his way out of the Church; and becauſe I knew we had a very ingenuous Gentleman living near, who had been ſtumbled by Jeſuites, not to acquieſs in the ſufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to determine all Controverſies of Religion; ſuppoſing this Gentleman might be preſent, and that the horrible wreſting of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by this wretch, might be no ſmall offence both to him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, furniſhing the Jeſuites with ſome advantages to inſinuate the neceſſity of ſome other Judge, beſides the holy Ghoſt (ſpeaking in ſacred Scripture) to decide Controverſies in Religion; therefore I deſired any Jeſuites whatſoever that might be preſent (or their friends) to take notice, that there were hundreds of godly learned Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Books I was not worthy to bear after them; and yet I ſhould not doubt (in the ſtrength of Chriſt) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter any Jeſuite of them all, in maintaining that great point of Doctrine, That the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in Scripture, is the ſupream Judge to determine all Controverſies of Religion; adding other things to the ſame effect; taking notice of the wiles of Jeſuites, who being beaten out of the field themſelves, by their Learned Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, did now ſeek to baffle us out of our Religion by a company of ignorant, impudent praters, that take upon them to be Preachers of the Word of God: and whereas <hi>Coppin</hi> had again and again ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that we Miniſters <hi>did envy the knowledge of the people, deſiring to keep them in ignorance,</hi> I profeſt I heartily wiſht that all men knew as much of God in Chriſt as my ſelf, provided I knew no leſs then I did; and if I knew any way more effectuall then other to improve the knowledge of others, I ſhould readily take it: In fine, I deſired thoſe that had given any countenance to this blaſphemer, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for what they had done, and do ſo no more, promiſing both by Preaching and Catechizing, to endeavour that all ſorts (even children) might be Antidoted againſt his errours; and <hi>Coppin</hi> having pretended that the right hand of God ſignified the Goſpel, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, under which all mankinde ſhould at laſt be brought, I alledged and paraphraſed on that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8, 9. with ſpeciall reflection on <hi>Coppin</hi> and his errours; but <hi>Coppin</hi> was reſolved, let me ſay what I could of him or his opinions, he would ſay ſomething after me, though nothing to the purpoſe, but only that like the Authour of the golden Legend, he might ſhew himſelf to be a man

               <hi>Plumbei cordis ferrei oris,</hi> I might adde, <hi>aeneae Frontis.</hi> When I had ended, and was reſolved to ſpeak no more, <hi>Coppin</hi> declaring himſelf againſt all water Baptiſm ſince the death of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as having neither precept nor example in Scripture: <hi>Gammon</hi> he ſtands up, and would fain have been ſaying ſomething, but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robinſon</hi> (I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) told him, he was a very fit man to incounter <hi>Coppin,</hi> for he had good lungs, and his tongue was well hanged, but now the time was ſpent, and they could ſtay no longer: When I ſaw <hi>Coppin</hi> would never end, I took my leave of the Aſſembly, with that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, Grace be with all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, Eph.</hi> 6.24. and ſo I went out; What <hi>Gammon</hi> ſaid afterwards I know not; I eaſily beleeve what <hi>Coppin</hi> prints of him, may be the truth of what he ſpake, for being a great dipper, I know him to be dipt over head and ears in many dangerous errours, and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if his bolt be ſo ſuddenly ſhot againſt thoſe earnall Prieſts, as he cals them, whoſe weapons are too ſpirituall for him with his carnall opinions and practices, as will appear (I doubt not) in due time. Theſe ſeverall publique Diſcourſes with <hi>Coppin</hi> being over, and he having now openly diſcovered himſelf before multitudes of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſſes, to be ſuch a notorious blaſphemer, and monſtrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſter, notice being given to Major Generall <hi>Kelſey</hi> of him, he was pleaſed to direct his Warrant to Captain <hi>Smith, December</hi> 19. requiring him to take <hi>Coppin</hi> into his cuſtody, <hi>&amp;c</hi> whereupon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Smith, December</hi> 22, apprehended him, and accepted ſecurity for his true impriſonment; but the next day (being Lords day) he ſet a Guard of Souldiers in the Cathedrall, with Order to hinder <hi>Coppin</hi> from preaching there, in caſe he ſhould attempt it, though he and his ſecurity were engaged to the contrary; yet ſo eager was this prater to be ſtill ſpitting forth and ſpreading his poyſonous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſo confident he ſhould have found a party of Souldiers and others that would have tumulted and mutined for him, rather then ſuffer an interruption of his deluding Sermons, that when he ſaw he could not be permitted to preach in the Cathedrall (which he endeavoured) he then attempted a publique prating, firſt on a Tombſtone in the Church-yard, and after that on a joyn'd ſtool in the Common, where he wanted not for Auditors to flock about him, but Captain <hi>Smith</hi> (in purſuance of his Order) ſoon ſilenc't him in both places, and diſpers't his followers, confining him to his quarters, cauſing him to keep himſelf private there, and to be forth

Generall <hi>Kelſey</hi> came to the Crown in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> accompanied with two or three Juſtices of the Peace, where upon examination of ſeverall witneſſes upon Oath, <hi>Coppin</hi> was found guilty of ſo many intolerable Blaſphemies and Hereſies publiquely avouched by him, that his <hi>Mittimus</hi> was made, and he was that day ſent away unto <hi>Maidſtone</hi> Gaole, where he ſtill continues priſoner; it was expected he ſhould have been brought to his Triall the laſt Aſſiſes, but it ſeems it was not thought fit to proceed ſo farre againſt him, what will at laſt be done againſt him I know not, only this I verily beleeve that Propheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Jude,</hi> will in due time take hold of him, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 14, 15. for my part I bleſs God his madneſs is ſo farre manifeſted (though not to all, yet) to many, that I hope he ſhall henceforth prevail no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this place; and truly if I were preſently to quit my ſtation, not only in theſe parts, but in this world, it would be ſome content unto me, that before my departure, God made me an occaſion (at leaſt) of reſtraining and hindering ſuch a peſtilent emiſſary of hell, from diſplaying a banner for the devil in <hi>Recheſter</hi> Cathedrall, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the courſe is taken to prevent either him or any other, from doing the like for time to come; yet thus much I can freely profeſs to all the world, that when I firſt undertook to appear againſt <hi>Coppin,</hi> and all along, in what I did or ſaid, I never ſo much as dreamt the iſſue would be what it proved, nor had I intentionally the leaſt hand in informing or ingaging the Major Generall againſt him; what was done in that kinde, was done by others (I know not whom) without my perſwaſion or privity; yet I confeſs when it was done, I could not but approve of it: I conceive the Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall did both himſelf and the State ſome honour in taking the courſe he did with him, and though I was not bound to witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him at the Aſſiſes, yet being deſired by two Juſtices of the Peace, I was there, reſolving had he been brought to his Triall, and my teſtimony required, I would have been ready to give it in, on the behalf of my King and Saviour, againſt ſuch a black-mouth'd foul enemy of his Perſon, Crown and Dignity, as this <hi>Richard Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> proclaimed himſelf to be; concerning whom, my judgement (upon ſerious examination and experience) is this, That he is <gap reason="foreign">
